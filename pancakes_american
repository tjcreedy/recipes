## Ingredients

Makes plenty for two people

Dry:
125g plain flour
1.5 tsp cream of tartar + 0.75 tsp baking soda
0.5 tsp salt
1 tbsp caster sugar

Wet:
200ml milk
50g melted butter
0.5 eggs (optional)

## Recipe

Melt 50g of butter

Sift 125g plain flour, 1.5 tsp cream of tartar, 0.75 tsp baking soda, 0.5 tsp salt and 1 tbsp caster sugar together together

Mix 200ml milk, the melted butter and, optionally, half an egg together, whisking until well combined.

Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the wet. Mix briefly until just coming together - not too much!

Heat frying pan to medium high heat, add some butter

Introduce 0.25 cups of mix to the pan, cook until edges slightly done and bubbles are forming in the centre, around
40-80 seconds. Flip and repeat. The first one always sucks, but it means you get a snack before anyone else gets to eat.
