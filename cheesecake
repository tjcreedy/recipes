## Ingredients

Will almost overflow an 8 inch springform

Buttery biscuit base:
250g rich tea biscuits or similar
30-50g butter

Filling:
1000g soft cheese
330g golden caster sugar
200ml whole milk
4 eggs
300ml sour cream
60g flour

Flavouring:
1 tbsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp lemon juice

## Recipe

Preheat oven to 170 C (155 C fan)

Line the base of a springform baking pan with foil. Butter the inside of the pan.

Crush up the biscuits into rough crumbs. Melt some butter over a low heat in a small saucepan and add to the biscuits. Mix well, the crumbs should darken slightly and just keep their shape when patted together. Add more butter if needed, but don't overdo it. 

Press the buttered crumbs into the base of the pan and, once the oven is at temperature, bake for 10-15 minutes until darkened. Remove from the oven and set aside.

In a large bowl, mix the cream cheese with sugar until smooth with electric beaters. Blend in the milk, then the eggs one at a time, just enough to incorporate. Add the sour cream, flour and the flavourings and mix again until smooth. Pour over base, shake gently to even out, smooth off the top. 

Place an ovenproof dish of water at the bottom of the oven and the cake in the middle. Bake for an hour until the top is browning and the middle barely jiggles when wiggled. 

Once done, turn the heat off and let cake cool in the oven with the door closed for at least 5 hours until back at room temperature. Then chill in refridgerator for at least several hours before serving.
