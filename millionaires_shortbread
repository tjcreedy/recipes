## Ingredients

# Shortbread

125g brown sugar
1 tbsp extract
0.5 tbsp salt
250g melted unsalted butter
300g plain flour
Raw/turbinado sugar, for sprinkling (optional)

# Caramel

120g unsalted butter
410g evaporated milk
200g light brown sugar
30g flaky salt (optional)

# Chocolate

200g chocolate

## Recipe

Prepare your baking dish by lining with parchment paper and greasing. 

Preheat the oven to 175°C.

# Shortbread

In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, vanilla extract, salt and melted butter. Stir to make homogenous.

Add all purpose flour and stir until the dough holds itself when pressed together, but is nice and crumbly

Press the dough into the pan using wet fingers. Flatten the top to ensure an even spread. Pierce all over with a fork, then sprinkle raw sugar across the top (if using)

Bake for 17-25 minutes until just baked. Remove and allow to cool for 2 hours. 

# Caramel

Put the butter, evaporated milk and sugar into a saucepan over medium heat, whisking constantly. 

Bring to a simmer and whisk for 15-20 minutes, until it reaches 113°C. It will stall around 107°C, but keep going. To get the perfect consistency, it needs to be at a temperature of at least 113°C and no more than 115.5°C.

Take off the heat, mix in the flaky salt (if using) and immediately pour over the shortbread, using a spatula to push into all the corners. Tap the pan against the countertop to pop any bubbles.

Set aside and let cool completely.

# Chocolate

Melt the chocolate over a double boiler, then pour over the caramel and let it set. Optionally, temper the chocolate.
