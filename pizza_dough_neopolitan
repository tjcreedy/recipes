## Ingredients

Makes approximately 800g of dough, enough for 3 medium pizzas

308 ml water
4.7 g (approx 2 teaspoons) active dried yeast
14.2 g (approx 2 teaspoons) table salt
473 g 00 flour (recommend caputo red)

00 flour for dusting during kneading
fine semolina flour for dusting during preparation

## Recipe

Add 4.7 g (2 tspn) yeast to 308 ml water in a large bowl. Add 14.2 g (2 tspn) salt.

Add 473 g 00 flour to the bowl and mix well until a shaggy ball forms.

[Optional] let stand for one hour.

Dust hands and worksurface with 00 flour. Turn out dough onto worksurface and knead until a taught, smooth ball is formed - around 10 minutes.

Let dough rise for 8-12 hours at room temperature in a container or bowl covered with a damp teatowel.

After rising, divide the ball into 3 or 4 balls, place balls in a container - it's fine if they're closely packed. Place in the fridge for at least four hours and up to four days.

[Optional] if leaving for more than 4 hours, stretch and fold each ball once a day.

Ahead of cooking, lightly dust a worksurface with fine semolina flour. Remove container from fridge, separate balls and place on worksurface, well separated, covered with a teatowel. Allow to come to room temperature and the top surface to dry out slightly, 2-4 hours.

[If using a home oven] preheat the oven with a pizza stone or steel on the top rack at the highest oven temperature for at least an hour. Immediately before cooking pizza, switch to the grill.

To make a pizza, thoroughly dust the worksurface with fine semolina flour. Place a ball of dough with the dry top side down onto the worksurface, dust the now top side with semolina flour then use fingertips to gently flatten and spread out. Further stretching can be achieved by gently draping the dough over your knuckles and stretching between hands. Leave a thicker region of dough around the edge for a larger crust. Ensure the drier side remains the underside of the pizza. Once fully stretched out, top with tomato sauce, oregano, cheese and/or other toppings. Do not overload; pre-cooking wetter toppings like vegetables is recommended. 

Gently move onto pizza peel and cook at maximum temperature for 2-4 minutes until well-risen and browned, rotating if needed.
