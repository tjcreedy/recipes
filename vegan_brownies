# Ingredients


85g finely chopped dark chocolate
50g coconut oil
80g boiling water

255g powdered sugar
76g all-purpose flour

3/4 teaspoon baking powder

6g dry malt extract

# Recipe

0. Preheat the oven to 175 C. Line a small pan with greaseproof paper and grease with coconut or vegetable oil.

1. Add chocolate and coconut oil into large bowl and pour over boiling water. Leave to sit and melt.

2. Add powdered sugar to a food processor (use half of the sugar if the food processor is small or you're doubling the recipe). Pulse a few times to coat the inside with sugar. Add flour, cocoa  powder, salt, espresso powder and baking powder. 

3. Sprinkle dry malt extract on the top of the dry ingredients and run the food processor on high, shaking as necessary, to mix well and remove any lumps.

4. (If the chocolate or coconut oil aren't melted, finish melting over a double boiler then take off the heat.) Let the wet ingredients cool and add aquafaba and vanilla extract.

5. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet. (If you didn't have all the sugar in the food processor, SIFT the rest into the mixture.)

6. Bake for 25 - 35 minutes, until a tester comes out with only a few moist crumbs. Leave to cool.
