## Recipe

In a small pan, combine 130ml extra virgin olive oil, 4-6 cloves of garlic, sliced lengthways, several tablespoons of dried
or fresh rosemary and thyme, and freshly ground black pepper. 

Place on low heat for around 10-15 minutes, until aromatic and before the garlic starts to turn golden. Remove from the heat
and leave to infuse for at least another 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, sift 1tbspn salt, 400g strong bread flour and 150g plain flour into a large bowl. Add 7g of active dried yeast,
ensuring it's separate from the yeast. Without mixing, make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients. 

Into the well, add 200ml of water and  100ml of infused oil through a sieve, retaining the herbs and garlic in the remaining
30ml. Mix together to form a soft dough that is not too sticky, adding 50-150ml more water as needed.

Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, before turning onto a floured worksurface and kneading for about 10 minutes until soft and
smooth, adding sprinkles of flour or olive oil as needed.

Use a small amount of your infused oil to grease a large bowl, and add the dough. Cover and let rise for 60-90 minutes, until
at least doubled in size.

Heat the oven to its highest temperature. Knock down the dough and turn out onto an oiled baking sheet. Liberally poke and
prod the dough out to cover the sheet, leaving dimples across its surface. Cover and let rest for 15-30 minutes, or until the
oven is ready. Slice up some olives, sundried tomatoes or other delicious things to add to the top. Could try pesto, shaved
parmesan (maybe add while cooking?), cured meats?

Mix around 15ml of water with your remaining infused oil, herbs and spices to make an emulsion. Uncover the dough and re-prod
to make lots of dimples. Pour over the oil etc, making sure to liberally spread around the surface. Sprinkle with flaked
salt. Add toppings, pressing into dough slightly.

Have 50-100ml of water ready in a mug, measuring cup or small bowl. Put the dough into the oven, then toss the water onto the
floor of your oven, quickly closing the door. Bake for 12-20 minutes until golden.
