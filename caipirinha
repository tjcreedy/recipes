## Ingredients

Per person

3 measures cachaca
2 limes
1.5 tbsp sugar, ideally brown
ice cubes (NEVER CRUSHED)

## Recipe

One or a few:

Cut two limes into eighths and add to a glass. Add a few ice cubes. Pour over 1.5 tbsp sugar and muddle until the limes
are completely juiced.

Add cachaca and stir. Taste and squeeze in more lime juice or add more sugar as you desire. Mix again, add ice until full
and garnish with a lime slice if you're feeling fancy

Plenty:

Add 1-2 limes per person, cut into eigths, into a cocktail shaker. Pour over 1-1.4 tbspn sugar per person. Muddle vigourously
and then add a handful of ice and 3 measures cachaca per person. Shake it plenty. 

Taste and add more lime juice or sugar as needed. Give it another little shake.

Fill glasses with ice and squeezed lime wedges. Pour in the caipirinha.

## Notes

This is not the IBA recipe. This is what you get on the street in Brazil. The glass should be swimming with bits of lime and 
the ice should be in cubes. The ice is there to keep it cool and help muddle the limes, not to water it down. Crushed ice 
destroys the impact of the lime and cachaca.
